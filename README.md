# java8
This project is used to test new stuff from java 8.
Each new functionality was created Class(es) inside a package with its name. So, for instance, the new Date API is inside com.mvalho.study.java.date_api.
All running code is in test source foulder. I did this because, for most of things I studied, I could check the result using JUnit assertions.
